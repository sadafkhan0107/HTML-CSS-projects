                I first met Courtney in my first year of middle school in my English room. 
                She was so warm and kind that I felt honored to speak to such a nice angel. 
                Courtney became my first true friend that I could ever count on. She was 
                always there in a heartbeat when I needed her wise words of wisdom.
